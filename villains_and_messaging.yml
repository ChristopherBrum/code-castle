  lair_intros:
    - The portcullis opens slowly with the gnargled grinding of gears and a dark entranceway is revealed. 
    - Walking through the entranceway leads down a dim hallway to a large stone room, cobwebs dangling from the ceiling.
    - In a shocked stupor you walk backwards into what appears to have been a great dining hall at one point, but is now is disrepair. Debris and bones litter the ground. 
    - Rushing from the last chamber you push through a wooden door that opens to reveal the castles kitchen, black with soot and mold. 
    - Examining the only other door from the kitchen leads into what miusty have been a pantry of some sort, which is now thick with the stench of vermin.
    - In the skirmish you happen to put your foot through the wall, revealing a secret passage that leads behind the kitchen into darkness.

    Congratulations Code Warrior, you are victorious! 
    You have fought your way through the foes of Code Castle and defeated their coding riddles valiantly!  
    The magic rubies you've collected will be enough to banish this evil from the castle for eternity!
    The Kingdom is once again safe, thanks to you. 
  boss_loser: >
    Today is a dark day for the Kingdom of Code Castle. 
    Tis true that you battled bravely, the dark forces that have taken over Code Castle have prevailed. 
    The magic rubies that you've collected were not plentiful enough to banish the evil that has overrun Code Castle. 
    Perhaps, next time, things will be different...
