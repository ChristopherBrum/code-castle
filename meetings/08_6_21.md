## Game Play

The Player is welcomed and the rules are explained

The Player selects certain options:

- Player name
- Short game (10 Questions), Medium Game (20 Questions), Long Game (30 Questions)

The Player is presented with an Enemy who demands an answer to a Question

If the Player answers the question right they may advance to the next enemy

- They gain a Special Token
- The player must have X Amount Special Tokens to beat the final

If the Player answers the question wrong, they cannot advance, they must answer another question from the same enemy

- If the player answers wrong, they lose a "life"
- A player starts out with lives that are 3% of game length

If the player answers all questions right and advances through each round of enemies, they have the correct number of Special Tokens

If the player does not answer all the questions right, they don't have enough special tokens

When the player runs out of questions/attempts, they are brought to a special final round screen where they have to fight the final boss, if they have the correct number of Special Tokens they win

A goodbye message that says either:

- You finished you cannot advance farther please try again
- You win
